# Manual Grading Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of manual grading functionality in the SCMS system, which allows teachers to manually grade students even when they haven't submitted work through the normal submission process.

## Backend Endpoint
The system now uses a dedicated manual grading endpoint:

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/tasks/{taskId}/manual-grade`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "student_id": "STU68B3F6580EFD1284",
    "class_code": "DK4F6H", 
    "grade": 7,
    "feedback": "Excellent work! Your research is thorough and well-presented. Great use of citations."
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Student graded successfully via manual grading",
    "data": {
        "submission_id": 34,
        "student_name": "Denmark Danan",
        "student_num": "2021456789",
        "grade": 7,
        "max_points": "10",
        "percentage": 70,
        "feedback": "Excellent work! Your research is thorough and well-presented. Great use of citations.",
        "task_title": "manual",
        "graded_at": "2025-08-31 17:34:56"
    }
}
```

## Frontend Implementation

### 1. API Service Update
Added a new method `manualGradeTask` to `src/services/api.js`:

```javascript
async manualGradeTask(taskId, gradeData) {
  return this.makeRequest(`/tasks/${taskId}/manual-grade`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(gradeData),
    requireAuth: true,
  });
}
```

### 2. TaskDetail Component Update
Modified the `handleManualGradeSubmit` function in `src/views/examples/TaskDetail.js` to:

- Use the new manual grading endpoint instead of the old submission-based grading
- Send the correct data format: `student_id`, `class_code`, `grade`, and `feedback`
- Update the local state with the grade information
- Refresh the task details to ensure UI consistency
- Provide better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Key Changes Made

#### Before (Old Implementation):
- Used `apiService.gradeSubmission()` which required a submission ID
- Had complex logic for handling assigned students without submissions
- Created temporary submission records locally
- Mixed manual grading with submission-based grading

#### After (New Implementation):
- Uses `apiService.manualGradeTask()` with the dedicated endpoint
- Sends data in the format expected by the backend
- Simpler, more direct approach
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Automatic UI refresh after grading

## Usage

### For Teachers:
1. Navigate to a task detail page
2. Click on the manual grading button for any student
3. Enter the grade and feedback
4. Click "Save Grade"
5. The grade is immediately saved and the UI updates

### For Students:
- Students receive notifications when graded
- Grades are displayed in their task view
- Feedback is accessible through the task interface

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Workflow**: No need to create submission records for manual grading
2. **Better Performance**: Direct API call without complex state management
3. **Improved UX**: Immediate feedback and UI updates
4. **Consistent Data**: Grades are stored in the same format as other grading methods
5. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback behavior

## Testing

A test file `test_manual_grading_endpoint.html` has been created to verify the endpoint functionality. This file allows you to:

- Test different task IDs, student IDs, and class codes
- Verify the request/response format
- Check error handling
- Ensure the endpoint is accessible

## Database Integration

The manual grading endpoint:
- Creates submission records when needed
- Updates grade information
- Sends notifications to students
- Maintains data consistency with the existing grading system

## Future Enhancements

1. **Bulk Manual Grading**: Allow teachers to grade multiple students at once
2. **Grade Templates**: Pre-defined feedback templates for common scenarios
3. **Grade History**: Track changes to grades over time
4. **Audit Trail**: Log all manual grading activities for administrative purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Error**: Ensure the task ID exists and the endpoint is properly configured
2. **Permission Denied**: Verify the user has teacher privileges for the classroom
3. **Invalid Data**: Check that student_id and class_code match existing records
4. **UI Not Updating**: The system automatically refreshes data, but manual refresh may be needed in some cases

### Debug Steps:

1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify the API endpoint is accessible
3. Confirm the request data format matches the expected schema
4. Check database connectivity and table structure

## Conclusion

The manual grading implementation provides a robust, user-friendly way for teachers to grade students without requiring formal submissions. The system maintains data consistency while providing an intuitive interface for manual assessment scenarios.
